    Responsive design is a way for a web developer to make a website adapt to all the devices 
    and resolutions.

    Endless new resolutions and devices are challenging to support separately for a web developer; 
    therefore, responsive design is the best approach to develop a website that can adjust itself 
    according to the screen size. 
    -->
<!-- 
    Various Ways To Achieve Responsive Design :
       By using rem/vh/vw units over pixels.

       By using max-width/max-height.

       Using CSS Media Queries.

       Setting up the viewport. -->
